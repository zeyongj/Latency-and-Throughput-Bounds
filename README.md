# Latency and Throughput Bounds

## Introudction
- SFU CMPT 295: Introduction to Computer Systems: Assignment 8: Latency and Throughput Bounds.
- A superscalar with six function units can perform integer multiplication and floating point multiplication with computation times. 
- For the purposes of the calculations, assume that the cycle time is 450 ps, i.e., an equivalent scalar machine would run at a peak rate of 2.22 GIPS.
- The base code contains a function min_max_avg() that does some data analysis on an N × M grid that represents a topographic map. 
- TThe function computes the min, max and average height of the entire map, but also of each row (latitude) and each column (longitude). With such information in hand, it will be easier to locate any
strategically-important high ground, but also any wind-sheltered valleys.
- Check the two PDF files for more details.
- The instructor is Mr. Brad Bart.

This repository is ONLY for backup. Students should NEVER use this repository to finish their works, IN ANY WAY.

It is expected that within this course, the highest standards of academic integrity will be maintained, in
keeping with SFU’s Policy S10.01, `Code of Academic Integrity and Good Conduct`.

In this class, collaboration is encouraged for in-class exercises and the team components of the assignments, as well
as task preparation for group discussions. However, individual work should be completed by the person
who submits it. Any work that is independent work of the submitter should be clearly cited to make its
source clear. All referenced work in reports and presentations must be appropriately cited, to include
websites, as well as figures and graphs in presentations. If there are any questions whatsoever, feel free
to contact the course instructor about any possible grey areas.

Some examples of unacceptable behaviour:
- Handing in assignments/exercises that are not 100% your own work (in design, implementation,
wording, etc.), without a clear/visible citation of the source.
- Using another student's work as a template or reference for completing your own work.
- Using any unpermitted resources during an exam.
- Looking at, or attempting to look at, another student's answer during an exam.
- Submitting work that has been submitted before, for any course at any institution.

All instances of academic dishonesty will be dealt with severely and according to SFU policy. This means
that Student Services will be notified, and they will record the dishonesty in the student's file. Students
are strongly encouraged to review SFU’s Code of Academic Integrity and Good Conduct (S10.01) available
online at: http://www.sfu.ca/policies/gazette/student/s10-01.html.
